## Usage üöÄ

### Installation

Before running the scripts, make sure to install the dependencies using:

```bash
npm install
```

### Scripts

#### Start

To run the main TypeScript file (`src/main.ts`), you can use the following script:

```bash
npm start
```

This script uses `ts-node` to execute the TypeScript file directly.

#### Build

To transpile TypeScript files into JavaScript, you can use the following script:

```bash
npm run build
```

This script uses the TypeScript compiler (`tsc`) to build the project based on the configuration in `tsconfig.json`.

#### Test

To run Jest tests, use the following script:

```bash
npm test
```

This script runs the Jest testing framework to execute tests defined in the `__tests__` directory.

## Mathematical Explanation üßÆ

### Calculate Intersections of two Rectangles

The goal of this use case is to find the intersection points between two rectangles, represented by sets of line segments.

Let R_A and R_B be two rectangles, each represented by a set of line segments S_A and S_B, respectively.

For each line segment s_A in S_A and each line segment s_B in S_B, calculate the intersection point P using the formula P = s_A ‚à© s_B.

The result is the set of unique intersection points { P }.

### Determine if two rectangles are Adjacent

This use case determines the type of adjacency between two rectangles.

Let R_A and R_B be two rectangles, each represented by a set of line segments S_A and S_B, respectively.

For each line segment s_A in S_A and each line segment s_B in S_B, determine the type of side sharing T using the function getSideSharingType(s_A, s_B).

The result is the categorization of the adjacency relationship between R_A and R_B into one of the following types: Proper (T = PROPER), Sub-line (T = SUB_LINE), Partial (T = PARTIAL), or None (T = NONE).

### Determine if a rectangle is contained by other

This use case checks if one rectangle is fully contained within another.

Let R_inner and R_outer be two rectangles, each represented by a set of vertices V_inner and V_outer, respectively.

Check if every vertex P in V_inner is inside R_outer using the condition P ‚àà R_outer.

The result is true if all vertices of R_inner are inside R_outer, indicating that R_inner is fully contained within R_outer. Otherwise, the result is false.

## Entities üß©

### Point

The `Point` class represents a point in a 2D coordinate system. It has methods for calculating distances and checking equality.

```typescript
interface Point {
  readonly x: number;
  readonly y: number;
  calculateDistance(point: Point): number;
  equals(point: Point): boolean ;
}
```

### Segment

The `Segment` class represents a line segment defined by two endpoints (`Point`). It includes methods for calculating intersection points, equality, checking if one segment is a subsegment of another, and more.

```typescript
interface Segment {
  readonly P: Point;
  readonly Q: Point;
  static parsePointsList(points: Point[]): Segment[];
  calculateIntersectionPoint(segment: Segment): Point | null;
  equals(segment: Segment): boolean;
  isSubSegment(subSegment: Segment): boolean;
}
```

### Vector

The `Vector` class represents a 2D vector and includes methods for creating vectors from points or segments, calculating dot and cross products, and checking if vectors are parallel.

```typescript
interface Vector {
  readonly x: number;
  readonly y: number;
  static createFromPoints(point1: Point, point2: Point): Vector;
  static createFromSegment(segment: Segment): Vector;
  static parseSegmentList(segments: Segment[]): Vector[];
  dotProduct(vector: Vector): number;
  crossProduct(vector: Vector): number;
  areVectorsParallel(vector: Vector): boolean;
}
```

### Rectangle

The `Rectangle` class represents a rectangle defined by an array of four points. It includes methods for getting segments, vectors, checking if a point is inside the rectangle, and more.

```typescript
interface Rectangle {
  getPoints(): Point[] ;
  getSegments(): Segment[];
  getVectors(): Vector[];
  isPointInside(point: Point): boolean;
}
```

### RectangleFactory

The `RectangleFactory` class provides a method for creating rectangles, ensuring they are valid. It includes methods for calculating the centroid, sorting points based on angles, and checking if the sides and angles form a rectangle.

```typescript
interface RectangleFactory {
  static create(points: Point[]): Rectangle;
}
```

## Use Cases üõ†Ô∏è

### CalculateIntersectionsUseCase

The `CalculateIntersectionsUseCase` class provides a method for calculating the intersection points between two rectangles.

```typescript
interface CalculateIntersectionsUseCase {
  static execute(rectangleA: Rectangle, rectangleB: Rectangle): Point[];
}
```

### IsRectangleContainedUseCase

The `IsRectangleContainedUseCase` class provides a method for checking if one rectangle is fully contained within another.

```typescript
interface IsRectangleContainedUseCase {
  static execute(inner: Rectangle, outer: Rectangle): boolean;
}
```

### IsRectangleAdjacentUseCase

The `IsRectangleAdjacentUseCase` class provides a method for determining the type of adjacency between two rectangles (proper, sub-line, partial, none).

```typescript
export enum SideSharingType {
  PROPER = "PROPER",
  SUB_LINE = "SUB_LINE",
  PARTIAL = "PARTIAL",
  NONE = "NONE",
}

interface IsRectangleAdjacentUseCase {
  static execute(rectangleA: Rectangle, rectangleB: Rectangle): SideSharingType;
}
```
